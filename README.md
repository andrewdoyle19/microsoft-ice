This is the 64-bit install image of [Microsoft Image Composite Editor (ICE)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/image-composite-editor/) which is no longer supported by Microsoft. 

Image Composite Editor (ICE) is an advanced panoramic image stitcher created by the Microsoft Research Interactive Visual Media Group. 

It used to be available [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/computational-photography-applications/) on the Microsoft Computational Photography Applications.

I downloaded it from a [CNET mirror](https://download.cnet.com/image-composite-editor-64-bit/3000-2192_4-75207152.html)
